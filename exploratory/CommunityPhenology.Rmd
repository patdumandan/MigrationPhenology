## **Chapter 3: Community-level Phenological Patterns**

### **Overview**

Understanding and predicting phenological trends at multiple levels of biological organization is important to reflect the extent of climate change impacts on various aspects of biodiversity. However, identifying the links between the observed patterns of phenological responses across scales is a nontrivial task for ecologists because of the scale-dependent relationships between phenological measures and their underlying drivers (Park et al. 2021). Moreover, phenological responses of species in ecological communities or assemblages can vary depending on environmental context. This is especially true for assemblages of migratory animals because changing conditions along their migratory routes over the course of their migration period can elicit different responses (Gill et al. 2019). However, given limited financial and labor resources to monitor all species, using an aggregate metric to characterize large-scale phenological responses may be practical. Its interpretation, however, may not necessarily be straightforward given the variety of ways an emergent community property/ assemblage-response can arise.

Assessing how individual species responses scale up to influence observed community-level patterns has been largely disregarded in phenological research (Steltzer and Post 2009). In fact, the effects of shifts in community composition and structure on aggregate phenological responses have generally been overlooked (Walters et al. 2013). Oftentimes, it is assumed that shifts in community-level phenology are driven by shifts in the timing of the component species. However, shifts in the relative abundances of species that occur primarily during certain periods in the season (e.g., early growing plants or early arriving migrants) can drive phenological shifts as well(Walters et al. 2013). Thus, examining the inferences drawn when community-level phenological responses are taken at face value, and how they correspond with constituent species-level responses can be informative of the link between phenological shifts at the species and community level.

In this study, I will use fall migration count data from hawk watch sites (with \> 10 years of monitoring data) that sample potentially unique flight corridors across three major flyways (east, west, central) in the contiguous US (at least 9 sites listed below) to examine community-level phenological responses. Specifically, for each representative watchsite, I will characterize temporal trends in the phenological metric (i.e., 10% passage date) that is biologically meaningful for monitoring the effects of trophic mismatch on fitness, to determine spatial patterns in community-level phenological responses. Then, I will calculate the relative contribution of shifts in species phenology and relative abundances (or compositon; Fig. 1) in driving assemblage-level phenological shifts using the metric developed by Walters et al. 2013 (Eqn. 1 below). By doing so, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of phenological shifts at multiple ecological levels of organization. ![](images/present13.png)

### **Analytical Approach**

#### I. Data Acquisition

I will download/obtain daily migration count data from hawkcount.org for representative sites in the:

a\. eastern flyway

1.  Hawk Mountain (Pennsylvania)
2.  Cape May (New Jersey)
3.  Wachusett Mountain (Massachusetts)

b\. central flyway

1.  Hawk Ridge (Minnesota)
2.  Detroit River Hawk Watch (Michigan)
3.  Illinois Beach (Illinois)

c\. western flyway

1.  Goshute Mountains (Nevada)
2.  Chelan Ridge (Washington)
3.  Bridger Mountains (Montana)

#### II. Data Analyses

Example site: Goshute Mts (Nevada)

**A. Spatial patterns in community phenology trends**

1.  characterize phenological trends for each of the 9 hawk watchsites ("community-level")

-   obtain dates when 10% of all migrants were counted\
-   use breakpoint model to identify historical ($T_1$) and contemporary ($T_2$) periods.

2.  calculate contribution of SPE(species phenology effect) and CE (composition/relative abundance effect)

$$
species phenology effect (SPE) =\frac{Σ relative abundance-weighted mean shift} {overall shift} (Eqn. 1)
$$

$$ 
SPE= \frac {Σ^n_{i=1} (T_{2n} -T_{1n}) p_n} {T_{2a} -T_{1a}} (Eqn. 2)
$$

where $T_{2n}$ is the intercept after the breakpoint for species n, $T_{1n}$ is the intercept before the breakpoint for species n, $p_n$ is the relative abundance (proportion of individuals of species n over total), $T_{2a}$ is the intercept after the breakpoint for the community, and $T_{1a}$ is the intercept before the breakpoint for the community.

$$
CE=1-SPE (Eqn. 3)
$$
